This project consists of two separate applications built in C:

Calendar: A command-line calendar application that allows users to view the calendar for any given month and year. Users can navigate between months and years, and the application displays the dates in a formatted view.
2048 Game: A classic 2048 puzzle game implemented in C. Players move numbered tiles on a grid, combining them to reach the target number 2048. The game continues until the player either reaches the target or no further moves can be made.
